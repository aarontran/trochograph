`trochograph` is a very simple test particle tracing code designed to work with
TRISTAN-MP flds and prtl outputs.  It borrows heavily from TRISTAN-MP code
(mover, code units, input parameters, etc).  Charged particles in uniform E, B
fields follow trochoid trajectories, hence "trochograph", a wheel-curve drawing
program.

`trochograph` is not much tested or heavily used.  No warranties, no
guarantees, no liability, nothing!  Use at your own risk.
